  Breaking changes

  This release contains major breaking changes to flag handling.
  * The flag library has been changed, all flags now require double-dashs.
    (`-foo` becomes `--foo`).
  * The collector selection flag has been replaced by individual boolean
    flags.
  * The `-collector.procfs` and `-collector.sysfs` flags have been renamed to
    `--path.procfs` and `--path.sysfs` respectively.

  The `ntp` collector has been replaced with a new NTP-based check that is
  designed to expose the state of a localhost NTP server rather than provide
  the offset of the node to a remote NTP server.  By default the `ntp`
  collector is now locked to localhost.  This is to avoid accidental spamming
  of public internet NTP pools.
